**Verilog Projects**  
*Verilog/SystemVerilog implementation*

A collection of simulation-based Verilog projects developed to strengthen my understanding of digital design, register-transfer level (RTL) development, and testbench-driven verification. Each project includes a testbench, signal tracing, and waveform output.

**Projects**

| Project             | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [counter-4bit](./counter-4bit) | A synchronous 4-bit up-counter with reset and enable logic. |
| [retro-vending](./retro-vending) | An introductory project into FSMs and video output as well as software/hardware integration. Simulates a basic vending machine.  |
