### 4-Bit Counter
A synchronous 4-bit up-counter with reset and enable inputs. This project is part of my practice with Verilog simulation and testbench design.

**Tools Used**

`EDA Playground`
`Verilog/SystemVerilog`
`Icarus Verilog 12.0`
`EPWave`

#### **Learning Objectives**

- Understand the basic structure and syntax of Verilog modules
- Learn how synchronous logic behaves with respect to a clock signal
- Implement reset and enable logic in a sequential design
- Simulate and debug digital circuits using Icarus Verilog and EPWave
- Interpret waveforms and debug signal timing in a testbench environment

#### **Project Features**

it counts. truly incredible, i know.
