**4-Bit Counter**

A synchronous 4-bit up-counter with reset and enable inputs. This project is part of my practice with Verilog simulation and testbench design.

- `counter.v`: Verilog module
- `counter_tb.v`: Testbench
- `counter.jpg`: Waveform for verification

Simulated using Icarus Verilog + EPWave.
